# What I gonna do?
In this repository I gonna implement std::vector from C++ standard library. 
The reason is that I am a newbie and, maybe, and this can help me write C++ code a little better.
And also implementing some classes and functions from std by myself is a good expirience
and it can give me more understanding how it works under the hood.
# What s next?
In the future I gonna make a cycle of similar repositories and implement some other std features.
# Post Scriptum
Last year I started learning C++ and doing something like this, but then I quit it.
I have tried multiple languages to know what do I like more.
And after that, now i gonna return to C++ because I find it more beautiful and interesting than others.
